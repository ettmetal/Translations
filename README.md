✨[Feature Wishlist](/wiki/Wishlist)✨

[Text]: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/script-Text.html

## Getting Started

You don't need code for the basic functionality of translations to work.

>⏳🌌 *The screencap gif travelled back in time to let us know it'd be here, but couldn't stick around for now. It'll join us soon, don't worry!*

>1. Windows/Translations
>2. Add locales
>3. Setup strings & translations in editor
>4. Add TexTranslator component to your UI Texts
>5. Select target string
>6. Profit?

If you want to do custom stuff, there's an API for that!

```csharp
using namespace Ettmetal.Translations;

Il8n.__("string-key"); // returns translation stored with "string-key" in the active locale.

Il8n.OnLocaleChanged += MyAction; // Subscribe an Action to be run when locale changes

Il8n.ChangeLocale("iso-locale-code"); // Changes the active locale to "iso-locale-code", e.g. "de", "fr-FR", etc.
```
Translations will manage storing and retrieving the current selected locale (using `PlayerPrefs`) automagically 🔮.

> *Full details can be found at the [API Wiki](/wiki/API).*

## Installing
For now, cloning the repository will clone a full Unity project. That's fine if you want to work on Translations itself, but you'll need to copy the full contents of the `Assets/Translations` folder into your own project's `Assets` folder if you want to use it.

> ⏳🌌*These steps refer to the __future__ of Translations.  
Best-case scenario following the below is __nothing happens__.
Better to be safe and wait for it to be released, though.*

> *Head over to [Releases](/releases) and download the most recent version appropriate for your Unity version. Import the package into your Unity project.*
